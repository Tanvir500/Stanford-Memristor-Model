# Stanford-Memristor-Model

The Stanford memristor model by Li et al. captures stochastic switching, multi-level cell behavior, switching voltage variation, and resistance distribution. It is based on 10nm TiN/HfOx/TiOx/Pt bi-layer RRAM devices, where oxygen vacancy dynamics maintain the conductive filament (CF). Tunneling gap distance (g) and CF radius (r) are the key control variables.
